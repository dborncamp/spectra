Spectroscopy training

Exercise 1:
 No problem getting the data.


Exercise 2:
 The differences in the STIS and COS files are that STIS is that COS is an 
'event counter' where as STIS is a normal spectrograph that only gives totals.
 The 2 COS files have different dimensions for events because there were more 
events in one wavelength range than the other.  


Exercise 3:
 No problems making calibrations. Very easy pipeline to run. Things stayed the 
same.


Exercise 4:
 They seem to be very close. Maybe a little more noise without the flat 
fielding. It is not identical to the flat corrected spectra. 


Exercise 5:
 A smoothing of (2,2) seems to calm it down a lot but the peaks have lost about
half of their value in the process. 


Exercise 6:
 COS seems to have better signal to noise on this object with better spectral 
resolution.
Signal to noise for COS:
   20.343151022
Signal to noise for STIS:
   12.1285375682

Exercise 7:
see my code for the plot. Interesting plot.
